# Rollback Deployment

This example shows how to use DSL to model  Application Deploy, Undeploy, and Rollback processes.

The primary features of this example are:

* A one-component deployment
* A Deploy process
* An Undeploy Process
* A Deployment with a Rollback built in
* The deploy process is deliberately simple - an echo statement.  No files are actually transferred.
* The artifacts are single text files with one sentence.  Several versions of each file are present.
